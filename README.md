Here, I post the list of code-based and software tools that I have developed or participated in them.

I have developed the following projects:

1) The Bio-Manufacturing project goal is to enable efficient operations of biopharmaceutical production systems when arbitrary configuration and setups considered concerning continuous manufacturing and use of disposable equipment.
For a discussion on the theory behind the tool, please refer to our CASE 2019 paper
Mohammad Hekmatnejad, Giulia Pedrielli, Georgios Fainekos. "Task Scheduling with Nonlinear Costs using SMT Solvers," 2019 IEEE 15th International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering (CASE)

2) CQL Verifier is a translator and model checker for CQL expressions that are represented in Clinical Decision Support Knowledge Artifact Specifications as ELM. Our tool parses and translates Logical Expressions in ELM into SMT codes. We use Z3 SMT solver in order to check the satisfiability of the SMT code.

3) Multi-Valued Temporal Logic Planner is an automata-based planner that enables path planning (and motion planning, which is ongoing work) when models and Temporal Logic specifications include uncertainty.
This project uses a customized version of the SPOT model checker available here: https://github.com/hekmatnejad/mvspot
The project is avalable here:
